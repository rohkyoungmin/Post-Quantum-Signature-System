# Lamport-Merkle Tree Based Post-Quantum Digital Signature System

## üîê Project Overview
The rise of quantum computing poses a threat to traditional public-key cryptographic algorithms (e.g., RSA, ElGamal) that rely on mathematical hardness assumptions. This project implements a **hash-based quantum-resistant digital signature scheme** by combining the **Lamport Signature** with a **Merkle Tree**. The system is implemented in Python and features a client-server communication model using sockets to exchange and verify messages.

## üìÅ Project Structure
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client.py         # Implements Lamport signature generation, Merkle tree, and client socket communication
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Server.py         # Handles server-side socket communication and echo response
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ  README.md         # Documentation
```

## üß† Core Technologies
### 1. Lamport Signature
- A one-time digital signature scheme based on hash functions
- **Advantages**:
  - Secure against quantum attacks (no number theory involved)
  - Simple structure
- **Disadvantages**:
  - One-time use only
  - Large key sizes (2 x 256 values)

**Signature Generation Process:**
1. Generate two sets of 256 random 256-bit values as the private key.
2. Hash each to form the public key.
3. Hash the message and select private key values based on each bit (0 ‚Üí set A, 1 ‚Üí set B).

**Verification Process:**
- Hash the message again.
- Hash the signature values and compare them with the corresponding public key values.

### 2. Merkle Tree
- Used to compress multiple Lamport public keys into a single root hash
- Allows reusability of one-time signatures by verifying a public key through a Merkle proof

### 3. Socket Communication
- Built using Python‚Äôs `socket` module
- Client sends user-input message to server
- Server echoes back the message
- Lamport signature and Merkle Tree root hash are computed on the client

## üõ† How to Run
### 1. Run the server
```bash
python Server.py
```

### 2. Run the client (in a separate terminal)
```bash
python client.py
```

### Example Workflow
- User inputs a message in the client terminal
- The message is sent to the server and echoed back
- A Lamport signature is generated for the message
- A Merkle Tree is constructed from public keys
- The root hash is printed and the signature is verified

## üßæ Key Functions Summary
| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `generate_private_key()` | Creates two sets of 256-bit random values as private key |
| `generate_public_key(private_key)` | Hashes private key values to form the public key |
| `generate_signature(message, private_key)` | Signs a message by selecting appropriate private key values based on hash bits |
| `verify_signature(message, signature, public_key)` | Validates the signature using the public key and message hash |
| `MerkleTree(leaf_values)` | Constructs a Merkle Tree from public keys and computes the root hash |

## ‚öñÔ∏è Pros and Cons
**Pros:**
- Post-quantum secure
- Simple and efficient with basic hash operations

**Cons:**
- Large key sizes
- One-time use constraint (partially addressed via Merkle Tree)
- Requires key pair pre-generation

## üí° Extensibility
- The Merkle Tree module is designed for modularity: any key algorithm (not only Lamport) can be used as leaf values.
- The number of leaf nodes (signable messages) is adjustable via `leaf_node_count`.
